# competitions-yii-1.1-webapp

This project is my graduate thesis that was done in 2013. In those days, I did not yet understand the meaning of using proper practices in code styling, variable naming and rational choosing of development kit. The WEB-development process has much changed compared to 2013, so it will be easier to rebuild this project than to do refactoring it. At all these years my job was not related to WEB-development, but I always wanted to be a developer. Now I will try to rebuild this project, but the original code I will save here as a reminder of how not to do. I need it for self-education purposes.
